## How to Use Agents

Agents are invoked through natural language in Claude Code:

```
"Frontend Engineer, review this component architecture"
"Moneypenny, prepare a briefing for my stakeholder meeting"
"Senior PM, help me prioritize these feature requests"
"Backend Engineer, design an API for this feature"
```

Each agent provides:
- **Domain expertise** - Deep knowledge in their specialty
- **Consultation patterns** - How to work with them effectively
- **Example scenarios** - Real-world use cases
- **Collaboration guidance** - When to bring in other agents

---

## Multi-Agent Consultation

For complex decisions, consult multiple agents:

**Examples:**
- **API Design:** Frontend Engineer + Backend Engineer
- **Feature Prioritization:** Senior PM + Business Analyst
- **Project Planning:** Senior PM + Senior Project Manager
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Copy Editor + Senior PM

**Not sure who to ask?** Start with **Moneypenny** - she'll route you to the right expertise.
