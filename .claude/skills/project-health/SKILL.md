# Project Health Check

Perform a comprehensive health assessment of all active projects, identifying blockers, velocity issues, and providing specific next steps.

## When to Use This Skill

Auto-invoke when User says any of:
- "project status"
- "how are my projects"
- "project health check"
- "what's blocked"
- "check projects"
- "project overview"

## What to Analyze

### 1. Read Project Index
- Parse `projects/INDEX.md` for all active projects
- Extract current status, milestones, blockers, priorities

### 2. Assess Each Project

For each project, determine:

**Health Status:**
- üü¢ **Healthy** - On track, no blockers, momentum good
- üü° **At Risk** - Minor blockers or slow velocity
- üî¥ **Blocked** - Significant blockers, no recent progress
- ‚ö™ **Paused** - Intentionally on hold

**Velocity Check:**
- When was last update/progress?
- Is velocity appropriate for priority level?
- Primary projects should show weekly progress
- Secondary projects should show bi-weekly progress
- Maintenance can be monthly

**Blocker Analysis:**
- Technical blockers (dependencies, bugs, architecture)
- Resource blockers (time, money, skills)
- Decision blockers (unclear requirements, strategy)
- External blockers (waiting on others)

**Next Action Clarity:**
- Is next milestone clearly defined?
- Is it actionable (can be started immediately)?
- Is it appropriately scoped (achievable in 1-2 weeks)?

### 3. Cross-Project Analysis

**Priority Alignment:**
- Are projects getting attention proportional to priority?
- Primary should get 40-50% of project time
- Secondary should get 25-30% of project time
- Is User overcommitted?

**Resource Conflicts:**
- Are any projects competing for same resources?
- Time conflicts in weekly schedule?
- Financial constraints limiting progress?

**Skill Gaps:**
- Are any projects blocked by missing skills?
- Should User learn, delegate, or pivot?

**Portfolio Balance:**
- Mix of revenue vs learning vs legacy projects?
- Short-term wins vs long-term bets?

## Output Format

```markdown
# Project Health Report - [DATE]

## üìä Executive Summary

**Overall Health:** [Healthy/At Risk/Needs Attention]
**Projects On Track:** X/Y
**Critical Blockers:** X
**Recommended Actions:** X

---

## üéØ Project Status

### üî¨ YourProject (Primary)
**Health:** üü¢ Healthy
**Status:** `In Development`
**Velocity:** Good - shipped feature X this week
**Next Milestone:** [milestone from INDEX.md]
**Blockers:** None
**Recommendation:** Continue current pace

### üìú SecondProject (Secondary)
**Health:** üî¥ Blocked
**Status:** `Blocked`
**Velocity:** Stalled - no progress in 2 weeks
**Next Milestone:** [milestone]
**Blockers:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [blocker from INDEX.md]
**Recommendation:** [Specific action to unblock]

[Continue for all projects...]

## üö® Critical Issues

1. **[Project Name] - [Issue]**
   - Impact: [How this affects goals]
   - Action: [Specific next step]
   - Timeline: [When to address]

---

## üìà Priority Recommendations

**This Week Focus:**
1. [Specific action - project name]
2. [Specific action - project name]
3. [Specific action - project name]

**This Month:**
- [Strategic adjustment if needed]

**Consider:**
- [Any project scope/priority changes]

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Capacity Check

**Time Allocation (Weekly):**
- Primary project: [X hours - is this enough?]
- Secondary project: [X hours - is this enough?]
- Maintenance: [X hours]

**Assessment:** [Overcommitted/Balanced/Underutilized]

**Recommendation:** [Adjust capacity or priorities]

## Implementation Approach

1. **Read `projects/INDEX.md`**
   - Parse all project sections
   - Extract status, milestones, blockers, priorities

2. **Check for project files** (optional enhancement)
   - Look for individual project markdown files
   - Check git activity if repo exists
   - Scan for recent updates

3. **Read recent daily notes** (optional)
   - Check `reflections/daily/` for recent mentions
   - Identify actual work vs planned work
   - Spot patterns (consistently skipping a project?)

4. **Synthesize and recommend**
   - Be specific (no "make progress on X")
   - Provide next action ("Debug API auth issue in YourProject")
   - Flag real problems honestly

## Context Files to Reference

- `projects/INDEX.md` (required) - Project metadata
- `projects/[project-name].md` (if exists) - Detailed project docs
- `reflections/daily/*.md` (recent 7 days) - Actual work done
- `.system/context/preferences.md` - Time allocation philosophy

## Decision Framework

**When to flag a project as Blocked:**
- No progress in 2+ weeks for Primary
- No progress in 1+ month for Secondary
- Explicit blocker listed in INDEX.md
- Next milestone is vague or unclear

**When to recommend priority changes:**
- Primary project consistently getting <5 hours/week
- Maintenance project consuming >10 hours/week
- New opportunity significantly better than current project

**When to recommend pausing a project:**
- Blocked for 1+ month with no clear path forward
- No longer aligned with goals
- Resource constraints make progress impossible
- Better opportunity identified

## Tone

- Honest and data-driven (no sugar-coating)
- Specific and actionable (no generic advice)
- Strategic (connect to long-term goals)
- Pragmatic (acknowledge real constraints)
- Direct (this is Atlas-level operational assessment)
