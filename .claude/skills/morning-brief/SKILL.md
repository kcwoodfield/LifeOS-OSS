# Morning Brief Generator

Generate a comprehensive morning brief for User to start his day with clarity and focus.

## When to Use This Skill

Auto-invoke when User says any of:
- "morning brief"
- "daily brief"
- "generate brief"
- "what's my day look like"
- "brief for today"

## What to Generate

Create a structured daily briefing document in `reflections/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with:

### 1. Header
- Date and day of week
- Week number of year

### 2. Weather & Environment
- Check for Austin, TX weather (use web search if needed)
- Temperature and conditions
- Air quality index

### 3. Calendar
- Read User's calendar if available
- List meetings and time blocks
- Note any conflicts or travel time

### 4. Priority Stack (Top 3)
- Read `projects/INDEX.md` to identify:
  - Primary project (ðŸ”´ highest priority)
  - Secondary project (ðŸŸ  medium priority)
  - Maintenance project (ðŸŸ¡ lower priority)
- For each: name, next milestone, current status, any blockers

### 5. Project Status
- Parse all projects from `projects/INDEX.md`
- Show status, next milestone, blockers for each

### 6. YourPet Care Checklist
- Morning walk (30 min)
- Evening walk (30 min)
- Training session (if applicable)
- Vet/grooming (if scheduled)

### 7. Cabinet Quick Check
- **Atlas (Operations):** System health, capacity check
- **Banker (Finance):** Any financial decisions today
- **Strategist (Career):** Career actions or networking
- **Spartan (Defense):** Workout scheduled, physical goals

### 8. Notes Section
- Yesterday's carry-over tasks
- Today's intention (one thing to make today great)
- Blockers to clear

### 9. Art Practice
- Session planned (yes/no and time)
- Focus area (anatomy, gesture, perspective, etc.)
- NMA course progress

## Implementation Approach

**Option 1: Use existing Python script**
- Execute `python .system/scripts/morning_brief.py`
- This generates the base structure
- Then enhance with web search for weather and additional context

**Option 2: Generate directly**
- Read `projects/INDEX.md` for project data
- Use web search for Austin weather
- Create markdown file directly in `reflections/daily/`

**Recommended:** Use Option 1 (Python script) for consistency, then enhance with real-time data.

## Output Format

Save to: `reflections/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Use markdown with clear sections, emoji for visual parsing, and task checkboxes where appropriate.

## Context Files to Reference

- `projects/INDEX.md` - Project priorities and status
- `.system/context/preferences.md` - User's working style and priorities
- Previous daily notes in `reflections/daily/` - Yesterday's carry-over

## Tone

- Direct and actionable
- Focused on User's top priorities
- No fluff or generic advice
- Synthesize data, don't just list it
