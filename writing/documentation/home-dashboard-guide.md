## Examples from Inspiration

### Beautiful Headers
Add scenic images to top of each panel:

![Cosmic scene](assets/cosmic.jpg)

# ðŸŽ¯ Alignment
```

### Colored Sections
Use Obsidian callouts for colored sections:
```markdown
> [!success] VALUES

> [!info] GOALS
> Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3

> [!warning] OVERDUE
> These tasks need attention!
```

### Visual Habit Tracking
Install Tracker or Habits plugin for visual dot matrix like the examples

## Philosophy

**From Atlas:**

"This dashboard isn't about tracking every detail of your life. It's about having the right view at the right time.

- **Alignment** when you're strategizing
- **Daily** when you're executing
- **Tasks** when you're in the weeds

Don't over-optimize the system. Use what works, ignore what doesn't. The goal is clarity, not complexity."
