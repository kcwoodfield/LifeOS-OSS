# AI-Powered Personal Dashboard

> **Status:** Active development | **Target Launch:** December 15, 2025

## Overview

An intelligent personal dashboard that aggregates data from multiple sources (calendar, tasks, email, health) and uses AI to surface insights and recommend actions.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Information scattered across 10+ apps (Calendar, Todoist, Gmail, Notion, etc.)
- No single place to see "what matters today"
- Manually checking each app wastes 30+ minutes daily
- Context switching kills productivity

**User Pain Points:**
1. "I don't know what I should be working on right now"
2. "I forgot about that important deadline"
3. "I'm constantly checking apps to see if I missed something"
4. "I can't see patterns in how I'm spending my time"

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goal
Build a single dashboard that reduces daily app-checking time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption:** Daily active use for 30+ consecutive days
- **Time Savings:** 80% reduction in app-checking time
- **Accuracy:** AI recommendations have 70%+ acceptance rate
- **Satisfaction:** NPS score of 8+ from beta users

## Target Users

**Primary:** Knowledge workers (PMs, engineers, designers) aged 25-45 who:
- Manage multiple projects simultaneously
- Use 5+ productivity tools daily
- Value efficiency and automation
- Comfortable with AI tools

**Secondary:** Executives, entrepreneurs, students with similar needs

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Unified Timeline View
- **What:** Single chronological view of calendar, tasks, emails that need response
- **Why:** Eliminate app-switching and context loss
- **How:** OAuth integrations with Google Calendar, Todoist, Gmail
- **Effort:** 2 weeks

### 2. AI-Powered Daily Brief
- **What:** Morning summary of priorities, potential conflicts, preparation needed
- **Why:** Start day with clarity and intention
- **How:** LLM analyzes calendar + tasks + email, generates natural language brief
- **Effort:** 1 week

### 3. Smart Notifications
- **What:** Context-aware reminders only when needed
- **Why:** Reduce notification fatigue, surface truly important items
- **How:** ML model learns which notifications user acts on, filters aggressively
- **Effort:** 2 weeks

### 4. Pattern Insights
- **What:** Weekly report on time allocation, meeting load, focus time trends
- **Why:** Data-driven awareness of how time is actually spent
- **How:** Analytics on calendar data, visual charts showing patterns
- **Effort:** 1 week

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes, tRPC for type-safe APIs
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase), Drizzle ORM
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI API (GPT-4), LangChain for orchestration
- **Auth:** Clerk (OAuth providers)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend + API), Supabase (DB + Auth)

### System Diagram

[External APIs]          [Database]         [AI Services]
- Google Calendar    →   Supabase      ←    OpenAI GPT-4
- Gmail API              PostgreSQL          LangChain
- Todoist API
```

### Key Technical Decisions

**Why Next.js App Router?**
- Server components reduce client bundle size
- Streaming for instant page loads
- Built-in API routes eliminate separate backend

**Why tRPC?**
- End-to-end type safety (no API contract drift)
- Eliminates REST/GraphQL boilerplate
- Autocomplete for API calls in frontend

**Why Supabase?**
- Postgres is battle-tested for relational data
- Row-level security for multi-user
- Real-time subscriptions if needed later

**Why OpenAI vs. local LLM?**
- GPT-4 quality significantly better for reasoning tasks
- Latency acceptable for non-real-time features
- Can add local LLM later for privacy-sensitive users

## Milestones & Timeline

### Phase 1: MVP (8 weeks)
- **Week 1-2:** Project setup, auth, basic UI shell
- **Week 3-4:** Google Calendar + Todoist integration, unified timeline
- **Week 5-6:** AI daily brief generation, prompt engineering
- **Week 7:** Smart notifications + filtering logic
- **Week 8:** Pattern insights dashboard, polish

### Phase 2: Beta (4 weeks)
- **Week 9-10:** User testing with 10 beta users, bug fixes
- **Week 11-12:** Performance optimization, deployment automation

### Phase 3: Launch (2 weeks)
- **Week 13:** Public launch, marketing content
- **Week 14:** Support and iteration based on feedback

**Total Timeline:** 14 weeks (Oct 1 - Dec 31, 2025)

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk: OAuth Integration Complexity
- **Risk:** Google/Gmail APIs have strict rate limits and complex OAuth flows
- **Mitigation:** Use established libraries (google-auth-library), test early, plan for quota increases
- **Fallback:** Start with read-only calendar access, add Gmail later

### Medium Risk: AI Quality/Cost
- **Risk:** GPT-4 API costs could scale quickly, quality might not meet expectations
- **Mitigation:** Cache responses aggressively, use GPT-3.5 for simple tasks, implement cost monitoring
- **Fallback:** Rules-based system for notifications if AI doesn't perform

### Medium Risk: User Adoption
- **Risk:** Users might not change existing workflows
- **Mitigation:** Make onboarding seamless (5 min setup), show immediate value in first session
- **Fallback:** Pivot to specific use case (meeting prep only) if general dashboard doesn't stick

### Low Risk: Performance
- **Risk:** Loading data from multiple APIs could be slow
- **Mitigation:** Parallel API calls, aggressive caching, background sync jobs
- **Fallback:** Preload data overnight, show stale data with refresh option

## Open Questions

1. **Pricing model?** Free tier (limited AI calls) + $10/mo pro (unlimited)? Or free forever?
2. **Mobile app?** Start web-only or invest in React Native from day 1?
3. **Data retention?** How long to keep historical data? Privacy implications?
4. **Team features?** MVP is single-user, but should we design for shared dashboards later?

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope for MVP)

- ❌ Mobile native apps (web-first, mobile-responsive)
- ❌ Team/collaboration features (single-user only)
- ❌ Custom integrations (just Calendar, Tasks, Email for MVP)
- ❌ Offline mode (requires internet connection)
- ❌ White-labeling or enterprise features

## Success Criteria for Launch

**Must Have:**
- [ ] 30-day personal dogfooding with zero critical bugs
- [ ] 10 beta users using daily for 2+ weeks
- [ ] AI brief accuracy >70% (measured by user feedback)
- [ ] Page load time <2s on desktop, <3s on mobile
- [ ] Zero data leaks or security vulnerabilities (audit complete)

**Nice to Have:**
- [ ] 50+ beta signups from marketing pre-launch
- [ ] Featured on Product Hunt or Hacker News
- [ ] Testimonial from at least 3 beta users

## Resources & Dependencies

**Time Investment:**
- Primary development: 8 hours/week
- Testing & polish: 4 hours/week
- Total: ~150 hours over 14 weeks

**Budget:**
- Domain & hosting: $20/month (Vercel Pro, Supabase Pro)
- OpenAI API: ~$50/month during development, $200/month at scale
- Tools: $0 (using free tiers during development)
- Total: ~$500 for MVP development

**Key Dependencies:**
- Clerk authentication service

- OpenAI API access (approved)
- Beta testers (recruit from PM community)

## Appendix

### Research & Inspiration
