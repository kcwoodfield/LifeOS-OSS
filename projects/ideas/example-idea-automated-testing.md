# Automated E2E Testing Framework

## Problem
Our current testing coverage is mostly unit tests. We lack comprehensive end-to-end tests, which means bugs slip through to production and QA is a manual bottleneck.

## Solution
Build an automated E2E testing framework using Playwright that covers critical user flows. Integrate into CI/CD to run on every PR.

## Impact
- Catch bugs before they reach production
- Reduce QA bottleneck by 50%
- Increase team confidence in deployments
- Enable faster iteration cycles

## Effort Estimate
- Setup: 1 week
- Write initial test suite: 2 weeks
- CI/CD integration: 3 days
- Team training: 2 days

**Total:** ~4 weeks

## Resources Needed
- 1 engineer (me) for 1 month
- Playwright license (free)
- Additional CI/CD compute time (~$100/month)

## Success Metrics
- 80% of critical user flows covered by E2E tests
- E2E tests running on every PR
- 0 critical bugs escaping to production (measured over 3 months)
- QA cycle time reduced by 50%

## Next Steps
1. Get buy-in from Engineering Lead
2. Write RFC with technical approach
3. Build proof-of-concept for one critical flow
4. Present to team for feedback
5. Get approval and timeline allocation
